Description
-----------

Abstact base class for everything related to Blazium services.

These services are designed to simplify game development with aspects such as multiplayer, authentication, etc.

Developers have the flexibility to either:

- Connect to the free Blazium services hosted on the `blazium.app <https://blazium.app>`__ domain.

- Self-deploy the Blazium services on their own infrastructure for full control and customization.
