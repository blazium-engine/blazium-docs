Description
-----------

The **BlaziumClient** node provides an interface for connecting to the Blazium services. These services are designed to simplify game development with aspects such as multiplayer, authentication, etc.

Developers have the flexibility to either:

- Connect to the free Blazium services hosted on the `blazium.app <https://blazium.app>`__ domain.

- Self-deploy the Blazium services on their own infrastructure for full control and customization.
