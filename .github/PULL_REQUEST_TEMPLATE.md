<!--
Please target the `blazium-dev` branch in priority.
PRs can target other branches (e.g. `4.3`, `4.4`) if the same change was done in `blazium-dev`, or is not relevant there.
PRs must not target `stable`, as that branch is updated manually.

The type of content accepted into the documentation is explained here:
